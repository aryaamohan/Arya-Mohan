However, the truth is, to earn a decent amount of money, delivery partners have to work for a minimum of 9 hours effectively to make enough deliveries to reach incentives.\r\n“The charges paid to the Swiggy delivery boys are, within the nine hours 45 minutes of compulsory login, for 32 deliveries Rs 1900, 23 deliveries Rs 1200, and 16 deliveries Rs 800. Many delivery boys work till late hours to complete 32 deliveries, engaging themselves for 24 hours.” (Correspondent, 2022)\r\nNow, with the increased working hours for delivery partners, their working conditions are deplorable because of the conditions of the Indian roads. Delivery partners need resting area. They have to slog continuously for deliveries out on the roads of India. With the pollution-filled air and the mediocre road building, many accidents or health issues are bound to exist.\r\nDelivery companies also provide a large backpack with a joining kit for delivery partners. These bags are usually filled and are very heavy. Carrying these backpacks as delivery partners ride their bikes significantly strains their back and spinal cord, which could lead to severe long-term effects. Guidelines like setting a load limit could protect the health of these workers. (Bilal, 2022)\r\nLack of Infrastructure/Benefits for Delivery Partners\r\n(Desk, 2022)“There are days in the week when Obendra Yadav, 19, is so exhausted riding his bicycle delivering food for Zomato users in Ghaziabad’s summer heat that he falls asleep without eating dinner. His wiry legs give in and the heat kills his appetite.” (Matharu, 2022)\r\nDelivery partners are not provided with any means of transport, fuel for their transport, resting areas for agents, or food with subsidized rates. These facilities are usually paid for by the delivery partners themselves, and those who can not afford them resort to using cheaper avenues, such as using a bicycle, not because they are eco-friendly. Delivery companies do not provide these to their partners in the name of ‘gig work’.\r\n“…His working conditions are gruelling but Zomato gets to greenwash its image by hard selling the bicycles. Marketed as a part of ‘sustainable initiatives’, the cost of such initiatives is borne disproportionately by the gig workers and especially by those who are the poorest in the company’s food chain. They are not registered employees of Zomato and fall out of the ambit of any social security provisions of the absent state as well as the exploitative private corporations.” (Matharu, 2022)\r\nDelivery partners can barely afford meals with the meagre 20 rupees base pay they get per order. They can not refuse to deliver either because they are penalized a sum more than their earnings in a day. Such are the desperate conditions that delivery partners work under as they continue to be exploited by companies that misuse the existence of a gig economy. Looking after these basic needs is the minimum that companies can invest in from a humanitarian approach.\r\nThe Partnership Scheme\r\nTargets\r\nSeeing all the problems indicates what companies must target to improve their delivery partners’ working conditions. A few of them can be listed below:\r\nEnsuring delivery partner safety\r\nProviding basic amenities\r\nImproving general delivery partner satisfaction\r\nApproach\r\nAfter gig workers formed a constituency to pressure the government, only recently have they been intervening to improve the conditions of these workers. They introduced a code on social security in 2020 that ensured various social security schemes like Employees’ State Insurance and Employees’ Provident Fund for workers. (Ghosh, 2021)\r\nMy approach to ways companies can provide for their delivery workers is through investing in infrastructure for their workers. However, the amount of capital this would take would be too high of an investment and one that would make a loss for the company. Therefore, delivery companies can instead invest in partnering up with other companies that already have an infrastructure set up on a large scale.\r\nIn the past, there have been rare cases of delivery companies setting up a few brand partnerships to provide for their delivery partners.\r\n“In the partnership, Reliance BP Mobility will be building an EV ecosystem and battery swapping stations for Swiggy’s delivery partners across the country. This move is expected to lower the running cost of vehicles by 40% for Swigggy’s delivery partners and lead to higher earnings. Swiggy explored switching to electric delivery fleets with electric bikes and scooter aggregators like Zypp, Spinny, eBikeGo in 2020.” (Pillai, 2021)\r\nPotential Partnerships\r\nE-Bikes - Yulu, Zypp, Spinny\r\n(Source: Yulu)Although this has been ventured into before, Yulu has even developed E-bikes explicitly designed for delivery partners. The implementation of this scheme has not been as successful as delivery companies have not enforced this as a guideline that must be followed. Although companies have made the amenity available, they do not sponsor the bike costs. Therefore delivery partners who already possess bikes do not try to switch to another means of transport.\r\nIf delivery companies provided a designated e-bike to each delivery partner as part of the starter kit, the change would be more widespread and impactful. Along with providing the e-bikes alone, companies must set specific goals to motivate delivery workers to use the same bikes. For example, suppose a delivery worker has reduced his carbon footprint by a considerable amount by switching to e-bikes. In that case, he/she must be rewarded with added benefits or slightly increased base pay.\r\nThis solution not only helps to increase delivery partners’ pay but also ensures some safety by placing a cap on the top speed that the e-bikes can travel, and also proves to be eco-friendly as it reduces the carbon footprint by a significant amount.\r\nCo-working Spaces - BHIVE, WeWork, Awfis, 91Springboard\r\n(Source: bhiveworkspace)Another major overlooked issue is that delivery partners barely get any rest. They do not have the time to afford rest, nor do they have a place they can go. Delivery partners are always on the road in between orders or even for meal breaks. This was a problem that I wanted to address.\r\nDue to this issue, partners are often exposed to several risks:\r\nAir pollution\r\nPotential accidents\r\nIrregular meals\r\nFatigue: dangerous for workers that have to stay focused on the road at all times\r\nThese issues could be countered by setting up stations or resting zones for delivery partners if delivery companies partnered up with other companies that already have an extensive network of workspaces. Investing in a partnership by mass renting out a portion of these workspaces exclusively for partners is a significant upgrade for the working conditions of the workforce.\r\nAmenities that the workspace must offer:\r\nLounges combined with a mini food court that offers food at subsidized rates\r\nSleeping pods for workers that are fatigued or sleep deprived\r\nA small infirmary that tends to minor injuries so that primary healthcare is accessible for free\r\nThese workspaces must be near delivery hotspots so that delivery partners can access them as they require. Companies could set up an allotment scheme that provides delivery partners with the time slots at which these workspaces are accessible to ensure that there is no overcrowding at these lounges and that everybody has a chance to enjoy the same benefits.\r\nExecution\r\nPlotting the Maps\r\nOrder Densities and co-workspaces\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmap_bounds <- c(left = 77.4, bottom = 12.8, right = 77.8, top = 13.1)\r\nBlr_Heatmap <- get_stamenmap(map_bounds, maptype = \"terrain\")\r\nBlr_Heatmap <- ggmap(Blr_Heatmap, extent=\"device\", legend=\"none\") +\r\n  stat_density2d(data=delivery,  \r\n                 aes(x=longitude, y=latitude, fill=..level.., alpha=..level..), \r\n                 geom=\"polygon\") +\r\n  geom_point(data=workspaces,  aes(x=longitude, y=latitude, color = company), size = 2) +\r\n  scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\r\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=rev(brewer.pal(7, \"Spectral\")))\r\nBlr_Heatmap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the Bangalore order delivery dataset, I plotted a heatmap of the density distribution of orders across Bangalore to show where most of the Bangalore deliveries occur. I then plotted the coordinates of the various co-workspaces across the city on the same map. These coordinates were sourced from OSMData’s website, with which I made a small dataset containing the names and coordinates of different workspaces to plot onto the same map.\r\nBengaluru (Urban) District Plot\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\r\n  \r\n# Plot the Taluks of Bangalore (Urban) alone\r\nblr_urban <-    \r\n  tm_shape(taluk %>% dplyr::filter (KGISDistri == \"20\")) +\r\n    tm_graticules() +\r\n    tm_polygons(alpha = 0.9) +\r\n    tm_text(\"KGISTalukN\", size = 3/4) +\r\n    \r\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE) +\r\n  tm_credits(\"Geographical Boundaries are not accurate\",\r\n             size = 0.5,\r\n             position = \"right\") +\r\n  tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) +\r\n  tm_scale_bar(position = \"left\") +\r\n  tmap_style(style = \"classic\") \r\n\r\nblr_urban\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing shapefiles from the Karnataka Geographic Information website, I plotted the various Taluks in Bangalore. I combined this map with the previous one to illustrate the density distribution across the Bangalore region.\r\nCombining the Maps\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nplot_grid(blr1, Blr_Heatmap)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above illustration indicates the intersection between delivery hotspots and workspace hotspots. It indicates that the well-established network of co-work spaces makes quick and easy access to delivery partners possible. If the majority of the working crowd lies within this intersection, they can take turns to rest while maintaining efficiency.\r\nThe reddish-orange bubble represents the delivery hotspots, while the light blue bubble represents the distribution of co-workspaces.\r\nSimulated Case Studies\r\nCurrent Workflow\r\n\r\nCurrently, delivery partners just hop between different restaurants and houses tirelessly to reach their incentives, and only go home to take rest once they earn the desired amount for the day.\r\nNew Proposed Workflow\r\n\r\nIn this setup, delivery partners keep alternating between working and taking breaks, ensuring that the demand is met while looking after the needs of the delivery partners. Both the delivery partners and the customers are satisfied. The key to making this arrangement work is that the resting zones must be located at an optimum point from the delivery hotspots, which, as I showed earlier, is the case.\r\nCitations\r\nCorrespondent, Dc. “Food Delivery Boy’s Death Sparks Protest.” Deccan Chronicle, 15 Mar. 2022, https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/150322/food-delivery-boys-death-sparks-protest-executives-boycott-work.html#.
